# Copy stuff

This repo hold code that keeps my couchdb stuff in sync with my psql
stuff.

It is a dumb idea to have two places to store data, but there you go.
You have to write code like this keep everything together.

Glue code.

# note June 2015

This code appears to only touch the VDS properties, not the detector
data or imputations.

Probably irrelevant because I have already merged updates into the
processing stream
